              <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Meem Madaat was conceived on <strong>1 January 2016</strong> by a small group of UK volunteers with family ties to rural Punjab, Pakistan. Inspired by Islamic principles of service and inclusivity, our founders set out to help poverty-stricken villages in the Jhelum district, while also supporting vulnerable people in Preston.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                From these humble beginnings, we formally established ourselves as a charitable group on <strong>15 January 2018</strong>, adopting our constitutional framework and charitable objects focused on poverty relief, health advancement, education, and community cohesion. We are currently working towards official charity registration.

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                At this early stage, we chose to <strong>"learn to walk before we run"</strong> by concentrating our first efforts on a handful of villages in the Jhelum district. We appealed directly for standing orders of just <strong>¬£3/month</strong>, distributed donation boxes locally, and began building relationships with community leaders‚Äîlaying the foundation for everything we do today.
